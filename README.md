# contacts2html

An `awk` implementation of @Sosol02's [`contacts2html`](https://github.com/Sosol02/contacts2html). Because why not :)

Converts a CSV file to an HTML table. It isn't actually limited to a specific kind of CSV file, as the name would imply.

# setup

The script requires that you have an implementation of `awk` installed.

# usage

Run `./contacts2html your-file.csv > your-file.html` in the directory where the script is located. You can then view the result in your browser: `firefox your-file.html`.

# caveats
